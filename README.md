Augmeted Reality  astrophysics game

This game explores augmented reality in a level of interaction totally amazing. As central storytelling, an ancient native Colombian culture called "Muiscas" anticipated an extraterrestrial invasion in operation with three relevant impacts. All of them distributed along years where humanity achieves cross-cutting astronomical advances. The years are codified in a petroglyph located in a remote zone outskirts of Bogot√° (Capital of Colombia) where those primigenious landers inhabited. The data collected from these indigenous artistic artifacts must be compared with a pack of cards from extraterrestrial origin founded 30 years ago when the pioneer's missions were started.
